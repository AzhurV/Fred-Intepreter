Operators and operands in artihmetic expressions do not need to be
seperated by spaces, but they can be.


Boolean expressions may be used to compare arithmetic expressions as well
as single elements
(i.e. 4 + 6 > 9 * 2)


Use of modulus operator on float values is permitted
if the decimal portion of the fraction is 0.
(i.e 6.0 / 4.0 permitted but 6.5 / 4.0 is illegal and
will give an error message)
